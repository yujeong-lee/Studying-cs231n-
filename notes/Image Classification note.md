Image Classification 

The image classification pipeline
- Input : a set of N images, each labeled with one of K different classes.
- Learning = learning a model = training a classifier
- Evaluation : we evaluate the quality of the classifier by asking it to predict labels for a new set of images that it has never seen before. (true answers = ground truth)
